# CodingBat
Working through the entire CodingBat website. I used the IDE to incorporate J-Unit testing and OOP principles. 
The exercises I completed can be viewed on the documents not ending in Test. I am progressively writing tests, in batches, 
for exercises already completed. This is an ongoing project.
